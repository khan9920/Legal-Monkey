                <p>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing - We are the sole owners of the information collected on
                    this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or

                </p>

                    share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to
                    fulfill your request.</p>
                <p>Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new
                    products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.</p>
                <p>Your access to and control over information - You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any
                    time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number
                    given on our website:</p>

                <p>Security - We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via

                </p>
                <p>
                    Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted
                    and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address
                    bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your
                    information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example,
                    billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The
                    computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure
                    environment.
                </p>

                <p> If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via
                    telephone at <b>+94727600759</b> or email via <b>support@legalhamster.com</b></p>

                <p>Orders - We request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must provide contact
                    information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number,
                    expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have
                    trouble processing an order, we'll use this information to contact you.</p>
